# Frontend

The React dashboard is designed to be modern, clean, and easy to scan. It focuses on the latest conditions with a trend panel for context.

## Overview cards
- Each sensor metric renders a card with the latest value.
- Cards animate in on load and show location metadata.
- Temperature values respect the global unit toggle.

## Trend chart
- Select a metric and sensor to display a time-series chart.
- The default window covers the past 12 hours.
- Timestamps are formatted in local time.

## Styling
- The UI uses a light, botanical palette with soft gradients.
- A single sans-serif font is used for readability.
- Cards and panels use subtle shadowing for depth.
